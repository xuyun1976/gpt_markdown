/// It creates a markdown widget closed to each other.
///
/// Deprecated because it is the renderer for the legacy regex pipeline, which
/// [GptMarkdown] no longer selects by default. Building it directly costs the
/// three things the plusparse path provides: there is no incremental segment
/// cache, so the whole source is re-split and re-parsed on every text change;
/// there is no span-level reveal, because a reveal here falls back to
/// [StreamingMarkdown] re-slicing the source instead of restyling spans that
/// already exist; and there is no viewport laziness, because inside
/// [SliverGptMarkdown] this path becomes one `SliverToBoxAdapter` holding the
/// entire document.
///
/// It remains what the legacy path builds internally — [GptMarkdown] reaches
/// it whenever `components`, `inlineComponents` or `incremental: false` is
/// passed — so it keeps working unchanged until it is removed.
///
/// Before:
///
/// ```dart
/// MdWidget(
///   context,
///   '# Title',
///   true,
///   config: GptMarkdownConfig(style: Theme.of(context).textTheme.bodyMedium),
/// )
/// ```
///
/// After:
///
/// ```dart
/// GptMarkdown('# Title', style: Theme.of(context).textTheme.bodyMedium)
/// ```

  ///    out afterwards for real — so it buys a second pass, not a cheaper one.
